# UNEMPLOYMENT
Unemployment is when someone who is able and willing to work cannot find a job, even
though they are actively looking. In Uganda, this is a serious issue, especially for young people.
Many are educated but still struggle to find meaningful work. To understand the problem better,
we need to look at the different types of unemployment, what causes it, and what can be done to
reduce it.
Types of unemployment in Uganda.
Uganda experiences several forms of unemployment, depending on the sector and the situation:
Seasonal Unemployment: This mostly affects people in farming and tourism. For example,
during the dry season, many agricultural workers have no work until the rains return.
Structural Unemployment: This happens when someone’s skills don’t match the available jobs.
A person trained in carpentry may not find work if most jobs are in ICT or finance.
Cyclical Unemployment: When the economy slows down, businesses may cut jobs. This type of
unemployment rises during tough economic times.
Frictional Unemployment: This is short term and happens when people are between jobs or just
entering the job market, like fresh graduates.
Youth Unemployment: Uganda has a very young population. Many young people finish school
but can’t find jobs due to limited opportunities or lack of experience.
Causes of unemployment in Uganda
There are many reasons why unemployment remains high in Uganda:
Rapid Population Growth: Uganda’s population is growing quickly. Every year, thousands of
young people enter the job market, but there aren’t enough jobs for all of them.
Skills Mismatch: Many students graduate with degrees that don’t match the needs of employers.
Practical skills like plumbing, tailoring, or coding are in demand, but not enough people are
trained in them.
Urban Migration: People move to towns and cities looking for work, but urban areas are already
overcrowded, and jobs are limited.
Poor Infrastructure: In some areas, bad roads, lack of electricity, and weak internet make it hard
for businesses to operate or expand.
Limited Industrial Growth: Uganda’s economy still depends heavily on agriculture and informal
trade. There aren’t enough factories or large companies to create formal jobs.
Corruption and Nepotism: Sometimes, jobs go to people with connections rather than those with
the right qualifications. This discourages many qualified job seekers.
External Shocks: Events like the COVID-19 pandemic affected tourism, education, and trade,
leading to job losses across the country.
SOLUTIOS TO UNEMPLOYMENT IN UGANDA
Solving unemployment in Uganda will take effort from both the government and the private
sector. Here are some practical steps:
Improve Skills Training. Schools and institutions like Entebbe agricultural institutes should focus
more on vocational and technical training. Young people need skills that match today’s job
market, like ICT, construction, and agribusiness.
Support Small Businesses. Many Ugandans are self-employed like in rural areas like in Masaka
and Gulu district. The government should make it easier for small businesses to access loans,
training, and markets.
Invest in Agriculture. Agriculture still employs many people like in kigezi irrigation scheme. By
adding value through processing and packaging, more jobs can be created in rural areas.
Build Better Infrastructure. Good roads, electricity, and internet can help businesses grow and
create more jobs.
Encourage Public Private Partnerships. When government and private companies work together,
they can create more opportunities, like in my district especially in sectors like energy,
construction, and technology.
Promote Digital Work. With better internet access, young people can work online doing
freelance jobs, running online businesses, or offering digital services.
Implement Employment Policies. Uganda’s employment strategy should be fully supported and
monitored to ensure it creates real change.
In conclusion, Unemployment in Uganda is a serious but solvable problem. With the right
policies, better education, and support for small businesses, the country can create more jobs and
give young people a better future. Uganda’s youth are full of energy and ideas what they need is
opportunity.
